## üìí Idea

The standard [String Calculator](https://codingdojo.org/kata/StringCalculator/) kata is much simpler that this one. The task is to parse the string, find all numbers and calculate the sum. There is also the [RPN calculator](https://codingdojo.org/kata/RPN/) kata, which is closer to it.

This one is the calculator, which is parsing the input (string) as [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) notated operation and return its result. In short: you can type the mathematical operation in *human way* and see the result.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Functionality

* adding, subtraction
* multiple, division
* negation (minus before some expression)
* power
* brackets (the round one only)
* float numbers, in simple and scientific notation
* simple validation (double operators, letters in place of numbers etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run

The module is ready to use:

```py
from calculator import calculate

print(calculate('32 + 45 * 34 - 23'))
```
